# Web Developer Bootcamp

These are all of the projects that I managed to create while taking part in Colt Steele's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' course on Udemy.   

# Projects Included

Things I Learned- Basic HTML file used to mess around with lists and basic HTML tags like strong and em.

Selector Exercise- An assignment where Colt gave us an HTML file and a CSS document with commented-in instructions. We had to make changes to the style of the HTML without directly touching the HTML itself. 

Pokémon Table - Basic introduction to how tables, links, and images work in CSS using Pokémon as an example.    

Sample Registration Form - Basic introduction to how inputs work, applied in the form of a basic sample registration form.

To Do - Basic To Do List with minor CSS. Moreso for just playing with inputs. 

Exploring Fonts - Playing around with the different syntax around fonts in HTML/CSS, as well as how to incorporate outside fonts into HTML/CSS files. 

Exploring Box Model - Playing around with the different syntax around spacing of elements in CSS.
