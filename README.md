# Web Developer Bootcamp

These are all of the projects that I managed to create while taking part in Colt Steele's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' course on Udemy.   

# Projects Included

Things I Learned- Basic HTML file used to mess around with lists and basic HTML tags like strong and em.

Selector Exercise- An assignment where Colt gave us an HTML file and a CSS document with commented-in instructions. We had to make changes to the style of the HTML without directly touching the HTML itself. 

Pokémon Table - Basic introduction to how tables, links, and images work in CSS using Pokémon as an example.    

Sample Registration Form - Basic introduction to how inputs work, applied in the form of a basic sample registration form.

To Do - Basic To Do List with minor CSS. Moreso for just playing with inputs. 

Exploring Fonts - Playing around with the different syntax around fonts in HTML/CSS, as well as how to incorporate outside fonts into HTML/CSS files. 

Exploring Box Model - Playing around with the different syntax around spacing of elements in CSS. 

Tic Tac Toe Board - I made a non-responsive Tic Tac Toe Board just to mess around with the basic CSS table and spacing properties.  

Photogrid Project I - I used HTML/CSS and a few black-and-white photos from some outstanding photographers to make a photogrid that resembles Instagram.

Photogrid Project II - Same photogrid style, just tailored around my brother and his sports. He's awesome.  

Static Blog Page - Used HTML/CSS to create a minimalist yet modern-looking blog page. Completely non-interactive, but cool nevertheless. 

Strapped Up - My own personal introduction (for myself) into Bootstrap, starting with components like forms and jumbotrons and, in general, getting me used to how to implement and use some of the features of Bootstrap (using version 3.3.7)

Bootstrap Gridding - Just messing around with the grid system in Bootstrap and using divs and containers. (using version 3.3.7)

Cleveland, The Gallery - Image gallery using the grid system in Bootstrap catered to my hometown, Cleveland, Ohio. (using version 3.3.7)

Sticking the Landing - Attempt at a modern landing page design for a website using my friend Koko as a muse. (using Bootstrap 3.3.7)
